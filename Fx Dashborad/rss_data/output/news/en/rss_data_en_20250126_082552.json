      "description": "<p>Will Chinese DeepSeek Disrupt NVIDIA and the American AI Industry?</p><p>The global AI race has taken an intriguing turn with the emergence of China's DeepSeek, touted by some as a potential disruptor to NVIDIA's dominance in the AI hardware space. As speculation swirls, stock investors, analysts, and thought leaders are left grappling with the critical question: Is DeepSeek a genuine threat to NVIDIA and the broader American AI industry, or is this a case of overhyped news amplified by interested parties?</p><p>The news that DeepSeek's model surpassed OpenAI's o1 in specific reasoning tests has sparked intense debate within the AI community. This development has significant implications for the AI market, potentially impacting the stock prices of companies like NVIDIA and other AI-related companies.</p><p>I’ll preface this by saying that I am not a renowned expert in deep technology or AI hardware. I don’t claim to have a definitive answer. Instead, I propose a method to find the answer—not by theorizing endlessly but by observing how the stock market reacts. The stock market, with its collective wisdom and ability to process information, often acts as the closest thing we have to a truth detector.</p><p>Let’s explore the context, evaluate the key factors at play, and develop a logical framework to assess the significance of DeepSeek’s emergence.</p><p>The Landscape: NVIDIA’s Moat vs. DeepSeek’s Promise</p><p>NVIDIA has long been the undisputed leader in AI hardware, leveraging its GPUs and CUDA software ecosystem to dominate the market. Its ecosystem is sticky—developers, hyperscalers, and enterprise clients are deeply entrenched in its platform, creating significant switching costs. This is not unlike Apple’s ecosystem, where loyal users and interconnected services create barriers to exit.</p><p>DeepSeek, on the other hand, reportedly offers a more cost-efficient AI solution. The analogy some have drawn is that DeepSeek could be the “cheaper smartphone” to NVIDIA’s “iPhone.” In the smartphone industry, the availability of cheaper alternatives has undeniably shifted market share, particularly in emerging markets. But did this disrupt Apple’s stock price or its dominance among its loyal user base? Not significantly. The same could apply to NVIDIA, depending on whether DeepSeek can replicate NVIDIA’s ecosystem or merely compete on price and performance.</p><p>The Role of Market Reactions: Finding the Answer in the Price</p><p>Here’s where the stock market comes in. Instead of relying solely on speculative opinions, I suggest that the best way to gauge the impact of DeepSeek is to observe NVIDIA’s stock price. The stock market is often a better truth-teller than any single analysis. It reflects collective sentiment, informed by analysts, insiders, and countless external factors.</p><p>What to Watch:</p><ol><li><p>The Reaction to the NewsSince the DeepSeek news broke, NVIDIA’s stock has not shown any drastic reaction. It actually rose apx 2.5% after the news came out, if we look at NVDA stock price from the next day it traded, to the close of the week. This lack of significant movement, not to mention lack of stock price decline (crash...?) -- suggests that the market does not yet see DeepSeek as a significant disruptor. If it were, we would expect a sharp and sustained price decline. Who remembers other cases, such as Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal a few years ago and the immediate FB stock decline? </p></li><li><p>Earnings as a CatalystNVIDIA’s upcoming earnings report will be pivotal. Pay close attention to management’s commentary, particularly regarding competitive risks in the AI space. If DeepSeek is a genuine threat, it could show up in NVIDIA’s guidance or performance, especially in its data center segment. I propose observing NVIDIA’s stock price from the time the news broke until two weeks after earnings. This period should provide enough data to assess whether DeepSeek is having a tangible impact, even if will not be talked about. The price knows, and it almost always knows better than you, or anyone else.</p></li></ol><p>Interpreting the Price Action Post Upcoming Nvidia Earnings (Scheduled for 26 Feb 2025): What It Might Tell Us</p><p>Scenario 1 for the Upcoming Nvidia Earnings Report: Stock Rises or Remains Stable</p><p>If NVIDIA’s stock rises or stays within its current range, the market is likely signaling that DeepSeek is not a major disruptor. Perhaps NVIDIA’s ecosystem is too entrenched, or DeepSeek’s solution doesn’t offer enough differentiation. It’s also possible that other factors, such as AI demand growth or NVIDIA’s new Blackwell chips, outweigh any competitive threats.</p><p>Scenario 2 for the Upcoming Nvidia Earnings Report: Stock Declines</p><p>If NVIDIA’s stock declines, the reasons warrant closer examination. Is the drop due to bottlenecks in Blackwell chip deliveries, macroeconomic pressures, or broader market trends? Or does it reflect legitimate concerns about DeepSeek? Analysts will need to scrutinize earnings commentary, data center revenue trends, and any shifts in market share. It’s critical to avoid jumping to conclusions without understanding the underlying reasons for the decline.</p><p>The Unknowns: Factors and Their Weights</p><p>One of the challenges in analyzing stock movements is that we can never know all the factors affecting a stock price, nor the relative weights of those factors. We might think we know, we may hear great explanations, but we don't exacly know. Earnings reports often illustrate this: a company might beat revenue and EPS estimates, yet the stock declines. Analysts scramble to explain why—was it slower sales growth, weaker guidance, or some other reason? The reality is that the stock market processes countless variables simultaneously, and not all of them are visible to us. The granular variables and their weights will never be known to us. But price knows.</p><p>The same principle applies here. Even if NVIDIA’s stock remains stable, it’s possible that DeepSeek is a growing threat but not yet significant enough to outweigh other factors. Conversely, if the stock declines, DeepSeek may not be the primary cause. This complexity is why I emphasize looking at the stock price holistically and over time, rather than rushing to judgment based on short-term moves.</p><p>Seeking the Deep Behind DeepSeek: Trust the Price, Not the News</p><p>DeepSeek’s potential to disrupt NVIDIA and the American AI industry is an open question, but the best way to find an answer is to let the stock market speak. Watch NVIDIA’s price action from the time the news broke until two weeks after its upcoming earnings. If the stock remains stable or rises, it’s likely that DeepSeek is not a significant threat. If it declines, dig deeper into the reasons—whether they’re related to DeepSeek or other factors.</p><p>While price action can act as a “truth detector,” it’s not infallible. The market may not immediately price in all information, and short-term movements can be influenced by noise, speculation, or interested parties (e.g., short sellers amplifying fears about DeepSeek). As always, exercise caution and remain open to multiple interpretations. But do follow the price more than anyone's opinion, especially yours.</p><p>Ultimately, the price knows. Follow the money. Follow the price and you shall be closer to finding the truth.</p><p>So far, here is the most simple price chart of NVDA stock within the past 100 days. I don't see any panic yet from the \"truth machine\", do you? You can decide for yourself is you see any DeepSeek news related panic. But let's wait till 2 weeks after the next earnings to unveal further \"truth\".</p><p>Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice.

Peterson,\nChief Economist at The Conference Board said: “The recent rebound in consumer\nconfidence was not sustained in December as the Index dropped back to the middle\nof the range that has prevailed over the past two years”.</p><p>“While weaker\nconsumer assessments of the present situation and expectations contributed to\nthe decline, the expectations component saw the sharpest drop. Consumer\nviews of current labour market conditions continued to improve,\nconsistent with recent jobs and unemployment data, but their assessment of\nbusiness conditions weakened.” </p><p>This might have\nbeen just an outlier among lots of upbeat economic data. Overall, we are\nstill in the range that has prevailed over the past two years, and we\nhaven’t got any strong catalyst that could suggest a sudden weakening in the\neconomy.</p><p>Wednesday</p><p>The Australian Q4\nCPI Y/Y is expected at 2.5% vs. 2.8% prior, while the Q/Q measure is seen at\n0.3% vs. 0.2% prior. The RBA is focused on the underlying inflation figures\nwith the Trimmed Mean CPI Y/Y expected at 3.3% vs. 3.5% prior, while the Q/Q\nreading is seen at 0.6% vs. 0.8% prior. </p><p>As a reminder, the\nRBA <a href=\"https://www.forexlive.com/news/aussie-unwinds-monday-gains-as-rba-softens-policy-stance-20241210/\">softened further</a> its stance at the last policy decision as it nears\nthe first rate cut. The market is seeing a 54% chance of a 25 bps cut in\nFebruary although the first fully priced cut is seen in April.</p><p>The latest <a href=\"https://www.forexlive.com/news/australia-december-2024-unemployment-rate-40-vs-40-expected-20250116/\">Australian Employment</a> report came in a touch softer than expected but\ndidn’t change much in terms of market pricing which was influenced more by the\nrecent <a href=\"https://www.forexlive.com/news/australian-november-cpi-23-yy-vs-expected-22-20250108/\">Australian Monthly\nCPI</a> that showed core\ninflation easing with the Trimmed Mean CPI Y/Y coming in at 3.2%.</p><p>A soft Q4 CPI\nreport will likely see the market sealing a rate cut in February already, while higher than expected figures might\nkeep it on the edge with the probabilities favouring an April action.</p><p>The BoC is expected\nto cut interest rates by 25 bps and bringing the policy rate to 3.00%. As a\nreminder, the BoC cut interest rates by 50 bps at the last policy meeting but <a href=\"https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/bank-of-canada-rate-decision-50-basis-point-rate-cut-20241211/\">dropped the line</a> saying “if the economy evolves broadly in line with\nour latest forecast, we expect to reduce the policy rate further\", which\nsuggests that we reached the peak in \"dovishness\" and the\ncentral bank will now switch to 25 bps cuts and will slow the pace of easing. </p><p>The recent <a href=\"https://www.forexlive.com/news/canada-december-employment-change-909-vs-250k-estimate-20250110/\">Canadian Employment</a> report was much stronger than expected, while the <a href=\"https://www.forexlive.com/news/canada-december-cpi-18-yy-versus-19-expected-20250121/\">CPI report</a> came mostly in line with forecasts showing once again\nthat the central bank got inflation back under control. </p><p>The CAD\nhasn’t responded much to economic data recently as the focus switched to\nTrump’s tariffs threats and\nthe negative economic impact they could have on Canada. Trump said that he\nintends to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada as soon as February 1st.\n</p><p>Despite the\ngeneral US Dollar weakness on tariffs optimism triggered by soft Trump’s\ncomments on China, the Canadian Dollar underperformed significantly its peers\nwith the USD/CAD rate remaining stuck in a roughly 150 pips range.</p><p>The Fed is\nexpected to keep interest rates unchanged at 4.25-4.50%. As a reminder,\nthe central bank cut interest rates by 25 bps at the last meeting in December\nraising growth and inflation projections and lowering the expected rate cuts in\n2025 from 100 bps to 50 bps (in line with market’s pricing at that time).</p><p>The central\nbank will likely stress the need to wait a bit more for the next rate cut to\nget more economic data and more clarity on Trump’s policies. As <a href=\"https://www.forexlive.com/news/feds-waller-will-support-further-cuts-in-2025-but-pace-will-depend-on-inflation-progress-20250108/\">Fed’s Waller</a> recently mentioned, the pace of rate cuts will\ndepend on inflation progress. He didn’t even rule out completely a <a href=\"https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/fed-waller-december-inflation-data-was-very-good-20250116/\">March cut</a> which was taken as a dovish surprise by the market. </p><p>The recent US\ninflation data came in softer than expected and marked the peak in the\ninflation hysteria and the repricing in rate cuts expectations. Before the\ndata, the market was even pricing in the chances on no rate cuts in 2025. </p><p>That was the\nsignal that the pricing was getting too much aggressive and in fact we just\nneeded a couple of benign inflation reports to get it back to price in almost\ntwo rate cuts by the end of the year (which would be in line with the latest\nFed’s projections). </p><p>Overall, this\ndecision is unlikely to influence markets expectations too much as the data in\nQ1 is what really matters. Despite the expected cautiousness, a bit more\npositive talk on inflation could see the US Dollar weakening further (as\nlong as Trump doesn’t spoil the party). </p><p>Thursday</p><p>The ECB is\nexpected to cut interest rates by 25 bps and bring the policy rate to 2.75%.\nThe recent <a href=\"https://www.forexlive.com/news/eurozone-december-final-cpi-24-v-24-yy-prelim-20250117/\">Eurozone CPI</a> report showed core inflation remaining pretty\nsticky, especially on the services side. </p><p>Moreover, despite\nall the doom and gloom, the latest <a href=\"https://www.forexlive.com/news/eurozone-january-flash-services-pmi-514-vs-515-expected-20250124/\">Flash PMIs</a> showed a notable rebound in economic activity which might even get stronger if the Russia-Ukraine\nwar gets settled. </p><p>Also, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-pushes-massive-pause-eu-red-tape-amid-us-pressure-2025-01-24/\">news on EU</a> to push AI, advanced research and clean tech in bid\nto compete with the US and China got louder with pressures to reduce and\nsimplify regulations and increase investment. The prospects of a great 2025 for\nthe Euro and European equities strengthen by the day. </p><p>The US Jobless\nClaims continue to be one of the most important releases to follow every week\nas it’s a timelier indicator on the state of the labour market. </p><p>Initial\nClaims remain inside the 200K-260K range created since 2022, while Continuing Claims continue to hover around\ncycle highs although we’ve seen some easing recently. </p><p>This week Initial\nClaims are expected at 220K vs. 223K prior, while there’s no consensus for Continuing\nClaims at the time of writing although the prior release showed an increase to\n1899K vs. 1853K prior.</p><p>Friday</p><p>The Tokyo Core CPI\nY/Y is expected at 2.5% vs. 2.4% prior. The BoJ hiked interest rates by 25 bps\nthe last week but didn’t offer anything in terms of forward guidance with Governor\nUeda saying that they have any preconceived idea and that they will make a\ndecision at each policy meeting by examining economic and price developments as\nwell as risks. The market doesn’t expect another rate hike any time soon\nwith the next one seen in October at the earliest. </p><p>The US PCE Y/Y is\nexpected at 2.6% vs. 2.4% prior, while the M/M measure is seen at 0.3% vs. 0.1%\nprior. The Core PCE Y/Y is expected at 2.8% vs. 2.8% prior, while the M/M\nfigure is seen at 0.2% vs. 0.1% prior. </p><p>Forecasters\ncan reliably estimate the PCE once the CPI and PPI are out, so the market\nalready knows what to expect. Therefore, unless we see a deviation from the expected numbers, it\nshouldn’t affect the current market’s pricing.</p><p>The US Q4\nEmployment Cost Index (ECI) is expected at 0.9% vs. 0.8% prior. This is the most\ncomprehensive measure of labour costs, but unfortunately, it’s not as\ntimely as the Average Hourly Earnings data. The Fed though watches this\nindicator closely. </p>\n\n                This article was written by Giuseppe Dellamotta at www.forexlive.com.",

      "description": "<p>Trump Coin (TRUMP/USDT): The Rise and Fall of a Meme Coin</p><p>In the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency, meme coins frequently make headlines with spectacular gains—followed by equally dramatic losses. </p><p>Trump mentioned (see in video below) that the launch of his Meme coin celebrated winning.</p><p>So far, it seems that he won, and buyers of this joke, lost. Ooops... You just got pumped and dumped.</p><p>Over the last six trading days, Trump Coin (TRUMP/USDT) exemplified this phenomenon, surging to a high of $96 before plummeting to its current price of $26.65, marking an over 70% decline. This kind of rapid rise and fall serves as a cautionary tale for crypto traders and investors.</p><p>The Pump and Dump of Trump Coin in Action</p><p>Trump Coin's price chart reveals a classic pump-and-dump pattern:</p><ol><li><p>Launch Hype and Early Surge:The token launched with overwhelming hype, driven by its association with a prominent figure, speculative buying, and exchange listings. Within hours, it soared to $96, fueled by FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).</p></li><li><p>The Crash:After the initial euphoria, the token began a sharp descent. Lower highs and lower lows became evident, signaling a lack of support and growing selling pressure. By January 25th, the price had settled at $26.65, erasing early gains.</p></li><li><p>Red Flags for Speculative Traders:</p><ul><li>Unstable Volume: Early spikes in trading volume suggest speculative activity, with large holders potentially unloading their positions.</li><li>Lack of Price Acceptance: The token failed to establish a support level at higher prices, indicating weak confidence among buyers.</li><li>No Clear Use Case: Like many meme coins, Trump Coin’s value was driven by sentiment rather than utility, making it prone to sudden crashes.</li></ul></li></ol><p>Key Tips for Buyers of the Next Meme Coin</p><p>As new meme coins emerge, crypto traders and investors should approach them with caution. Here are essential tips to avoid falling into the FOMO trap:</p><p>1. Patience Pays Off</p><ul><li>Avoid Jumping in Too Early: The initial phase of a meme coin’s lifecycle is often marked by extreme volatility. Prices are inflated by speculative buying, and latecomers often bear the brunt of the inevitable sell-off.</li><li>Wait for Price Action to Stabilize: Observe whether the coin finds acceptance at support levels. If prices consolidate at higher levels after the initial surge, it may indicate stronger buyer interest and reduce downside risks.</li></ul><p>2. Beware of FOMO</p><ul><li>Don't Be Swayed by Hype: Coins associated with big names or trending topics often ride a wave of publicity. While this can generate short-term gains, the hype is rarely sustainable.</li><li>Understand the Risks of Branding: Just because a token is linked to a well-known brand or figure (like Trump Coin) doesn’t mean it will hold its value. These coins are often driven by sentiment rather than fundamentals.</li></ul><p>3. Focus on Price Acceptance</p><ul><li>Look for Support Levels: A key sign of stability is the token’s ability to hold its value within key price zones. If the price keeps breaking through supports, it signals a lack of interest from buyers.</li><li>Volume and Buy-Side Activity: Watch for consistent buy-side activity and increasing trading volume at support levels, which indicate stronger market interest.</li></ul><p>4. Timing Is Everything</p><ul><li>Launch Buyers Have the Advantage: Those who buy at launch and exit quickly after a spike tend to profit most in these scenarios. If you miss the initial surge, wait for confirmation of price stability before entering.</li><li>Avoid the Mid-Hype Entry: Entering during the peak of FOMO is risky. Waiting for the hype to settle and assessing whether the coin is gaining genuine traction is a smarter approach.</li></ul><p>5. Research the Tokenomics</p><ul><li>Understand Supply Dynamics: Events like token unlocks can flood the market with supply, driving prices down. Know when these events are scheduled before committing funds.</li><li>Check for Utility: Meme coins with no clear use case or development roadmap are less likely to hold long-term value. Tokens with utility or innovative features have a better chance of sustaining their gains.</li></ul><p>6. Set Clear Risk Management Rules</p><ul><li>Use Stop-Loss Orders: Protect your investment by setting stop-loss orders to minimize losses in case the price falls unexpectedly.</li><li>Take Partial Profits: If you’ve profited from an early price surge, consider taking some money off the table to lock in gains.</li></ul><p>Final Thoughts on Trump Coin, FOMO, and Pump &amp; Dump</p><p>Trump Coin’s rapid rise and fall highlights the dangers of succumbing to FOMO and speculative hype. Meme coins may offer incredible opportunities for quick gains, but they are inherently high-risk. The lessons for traders are clear: be patient, watch for price acceptance at support levels, and avoid chasing unsustainable trends. Remember, timing and disciplined risk management are your best allies in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>As new meme coins inevitably enter the market, traders who stay calm, analyze price action, and resist the lure of FOMO will be better positioned to navigate these speculative waters and protect their capital. Always approach meme coins with a critical eye, and never invest more than you’re prepared to lose.</p><p>Be careful not to get pumped and dumped and visit <a href=\"https://www.forexlive.com/\" rel=\"follow\" target=\"_self\">ForexLive.com</a> for additional, original, authentic perspectives.</p>\n\n                This article was written by Itai Levitan at www.forexlive.com.",

It says that -- contrary to reports at the time -- that yestrday's executive order from Trump will cut off foreign aid to Ukraine.</p><blockquote class=\"story-text__paragraph text-align-left\">Secretary of State Marco Rubio halted spending Friday on most existing foreign aid grants for 90 days. The order, which shocked State Department officials, appears to apply to funding for military assistance to Ukraine.</blockquote><blockquote class=\"story-text__paragraph  \">Rubio’s guidance, issued to all diplomatic and consular posts, requires department staffers to issue “stop-work orders” on nearly all “existing foreign assistance awards,” according to the document, which was obtained by POLITICO. It is effective immediately.</blockquote><p>My guess here is that Politico got something wrong or there is some confusion at the State Dept because this goes directly against what they were saying.</p><blockquote>The new guidance means no further actions will be taken to disperse aid funding to programs already approved by the U.S. government, according to three current and two former officials familiar with the new guidance.</blockquote><p>Rubio has been a supporter of Ukraine and a hawk from the beginning so it would be an odd twist from him as well. That said, Trump lately has talked about pressuring Ukraine to accept some sort of peace.</p>\n\n                This article was written by Adam Button at www.forexlive.com.",

He's trying to tap into that spirit in his campaign launch for party leadership.</p><p>Now I don't think he's hitting those notes particularly well but it's early days in the contest that will run through March. If he goes hard on that theme, I think it resonates.</p><p>\"Good governments empower their citizens to build great things,\" Carney says in his campaign ad.</p><p>I think it resonates everywhere but the problem is that the bureaucracy and courts are so dug in that's it's extremely difficult to change. Canada's system shares power federally, provincially, municipally and increasingly with the indigenous population. That's paralyzed the country and led to a $7 billion pipeline to the west coast ballooning in cost to $35 billion.</p><p>It's a similar story elsewhere in the developed world and often in the developing world where mines now take upwards of 10 years to be built.</p><p>So who wins? </p><p>It's tough to bet against the United States. Trump is already trying to use his emergency power for approvals and there are many states on board. The US does have high labor costs though and real estate is expensive but US pockets are deep so higher costs can be tolerated better than elsewhere. The Keystone XL pipeline shows all the ways that building can be obstructed.</p><p>I think the mood in the UK is strong around this and I'm hopeful they can move more-quickly on nuclear, for starters. What's problematic is that London is such a big part of the economy and there certainly isn't a consensus to start bulldozing neighbourhoods for infrastructure.</p><p>Australia is a decent spot for mining so they have at least that going for it. They've managed to get into the LNG game and the proximity to Asia has been beneficial. Real estate is terribly expensive though.</p><p>Europe might be the biggest opportunity but it's fragmented. It would be great if someone there could break away and really set a tone. Germans are some of the greatest builders but they've fallen so far behind and France is France. Is Italy having any success with a new government?</p><p>I don't have answers at the moment but I would love to see one of these places really go for it -- maybe build a planned city or some massive projects. I'd be a buyer of that but for now I'm a watcher.</p>\n\n                This article was written by Adam Button at www.forexlive.com.",

Today there was a pair of economic data releases that were far-from-perfect. The S&amp;P Global services PMI fell to the lowest since April and the UMich consumer confidence survey was revised lower.</p><p>At the same time, the PMIs out of the eurozone and UK were better than expected.</p><p>That's been enough to launch a 140-pip squeeze higher in cable to 1.2490. So far offers at 1.2500 are holding but it's been a big move that builds off a similar-sized pop last week.</p><p>Another notable call today (though it goes against the idea of this being an extremely-contrarian trade) came from Blackrock's Larry Fink who <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/davos-blackrocks-fink-says-probably-time-be-investing-back-europe-2025-01-24/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">said </a>there is too much pessimism around Europe and it could be time to be investing again.</p><p>Similarly, Christine Lagarde said this:</p><blockquote>\"If European leaders can get their act together and respond to this \nexistential threat, there is a huge potential for Europe to respond to \nthe call,\" she said.</blockquote><p>That is certainty a tall order given Europe's bureaucracy but it's an opportunity.</p><p>I believe that the best place to invest in the developed world for the next decade will be whatever country figures out how to build things again.

I wrote:</p><ul class=\"text-align-start vertical-align-baseline\"><li class=\"vertical-align-baseline\">The EURUSD broke higher today with a move above a swing area between 1.0448 and 1.0461 and the 61.8% of the move down from the December high (at 1.0456). Going forward, staying above that area is more bullish. ON the topside, there is a swing area between 1.0532 to 1.0543.</li></ul><p>The price in the US morning session corrected lower, BUT it did find support buyers near the high of the swing area at 1.0461. The low price fell to a low of 1.0466 and bounced.  Bulls and buyers are in control.  Dip buyers leaned against the break point. </p><p>What now? What next going into the close and into the new week?</p><p>On the downside, the story remains the same with the 1.0448 to 1.0461 is the key level. Move below, and I would expect buyers turn to sellers on the disappointment from the break. </p><p>Stay above the breakpoint at 1.0448 to 1.0461 and the topside can be further explored/probed.</p><p>The next target (as outlined in the earlier post) is at 1.05325 to 1.05433. Move above that, and 1.05926 to 1.0609 will be targeted followed by the December high at 1.06293. Get above that, and the 100 day MA is at 1.06952 as is the 50% midpoint of the move down from the EURUSD 2024 high to the low reached in January.   Put a star on your chart at that area.</p><p>Next week, the ECB and the Fed both meet. The expectation is that the Fed remains unchanged and the ECB is expecte to cut. That should weaken the EURUSD. That should keep a lid on the pair.  So sellers may look at 1.0532 to 1.0543 for a place to sell with stops above.  </p><p>However, stories can change. </p><ul><li>Waller last week was more dovish.  </li><li>Trump has demanded lower rates.  </li></ul><p>Much is dependent on inflation and growth. Trump says he will bring it down. Will the promises lead to results, in which case the dollar may continue the move lower. The technicals help to provide the clues to the markets bias shifts.   </p>\n\n                This article was written by Greg Michalowski at www.forexlive.com.",

Higher input cost and selling price\ninflation was broad-based across goods and services and, if\nsustained, could add to worries that a combination of robust\neconomic growth, a strong job market, and higher inflation\ncould encourage a more hawkish policy approach from the\nFed.\"</blockquote><p>The chart shows a visible uptick in inflation but it's still far below 2021-2023 levels.</p>\n\n                This article was written by Adam Button at www.forexlive.com.",
